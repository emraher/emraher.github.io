I live in Ankara with my wife and our 4 cats (Badem, Alfred, Frida, and Duman).

I am a Research Assistant at [Ankara University Economics Department](http://www.politics.ankara.edu.tr/iktisat/).

I teach undergraduate statistics and data science courses. 

My research interests include Agricultural Economics, Environmental Economics, and Applied Econometrics. I am a member of [DigitalLab Mulkiye](https://www.dlabmulkiye-en.org/). I like coding in R and writing useless R packages.

You can find my CV [here]().
